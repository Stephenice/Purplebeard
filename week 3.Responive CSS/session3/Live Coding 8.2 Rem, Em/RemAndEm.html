      <p>My parent div has a font set of 24px.</p>
      <p class="rem2">
        I am 1rem so I am the root font which is 16px. Rem's stay contant where
        ever they are
      </p>
      <p class="em2">
        I am 1em which is 24px as my parent now had a font-size of 24px. Em's
        change whenever their parents change font size which can be confusing!
      </p>
      <p class="em3">
        We often set padding in ems or rems as it stay in proportion to text
        size when user zoom in or change font size.
