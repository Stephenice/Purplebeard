        HERE is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the
        back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows,
        the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there
        really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and
        think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the
        bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, But I
        thought he was a boy?
      </p>
      <p>So did I, said Christopher Robin.</p>
      <p>Then you can't call him Winnie?</p>
      <p>I don't.</p>
      <p>But you said</p>
      <p>He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what 'ther' means?</p>
      <p>
        Ah, yes, now I do, I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is
        all the explanation you are going to get.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes
        downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire
        and listen to a story. This evening
      </p>
      <p>What about a story? said Christopher Robin.</p>
      <p>What about a story? I said.</p>
      <p>Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?</p>
      <p>I suppose I could, I said. What sort of stories does he like?</p>
      <p>About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear.</p>
      <p>Oh, I see.</p>
      <p>So could you very sweetly?</p>
      <p>I'll try, I said.</p>
      <p>So I tried.</p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday,
        Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of
        Sanders.
      </p>
      <p>
        (What does 'under the name' mean? asked Christopher Robin. It means he
        had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it.
      </p>
      <p>Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure, said Christopher Robin.</p>
      <p>Now I am, said a growly voice.</p>
      <p>Then I will go on, said I.)</p>
